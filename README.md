# **foodVerse**

A food listings project utilizing YELP’s API - [http://foodverse.herokuapp.com/]

## **Description**
FoodVerse is a project utilizing YELP’s API and a filtering system to exclude chains and expel them from users search results. The user will simply need to enter an address to be presented with a list of up to 100 restaurants ordered from closest to furthest restaurant based on the address given. Furthermore, a user who chooses to log on with their snapchat ID can select a restaurant of their choice to recommend the restaurant to their friends. list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## **Roadmap**
Final versions of the project will include:
* Polling system between friend groups to choose a restaurant
* Snap authentication for bitmoji avatar markers next to user selection
* Snap selfie with snap filter next to your recommendation 
* Users may leave a review that will be hosted on foodVerse 

## **Future Features**
* Snap Kit AUTH
   
   * Users will need snapKit to log in (since this is a snap mini) and if they decline, they may use a “guest” profile, but cannot use the suggest functionality
   * SnapKit Auth will display their bitmoji while they browse, and keep track of their suggestions using the SnapKit info
   * On the snap Mini, the current “session” will involve all currently logged in snap users on the current group chat. Suggest functionality will only be between those 

* Suggestions

   * Each user in the current group chat on snap can use the app within the same session, where they can each suggest a restaurant they’d like to eat at.
   * On the Suggest viewing page, the users in the current session can vote on which restaurant they’d like to eat at

* Filters
   
   * Users can take a picture with a filter showing their suggestion and send it to the group so other users can view suggestions
   * If a restaurant is chosen to go to, then users can take a picture with a different filter at the restaurant
   * The user can also take a picture of their food at the restaurant and save that within our app, so when future users look at the website they can see past snaps located at that restaurant
